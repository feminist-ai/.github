[![We aim to create a safe, inclusive and hacker-oriented space for experimenting with the intersection of feminism and artificial intelligence. Feminist AI LAN Parties are participatory events where everyone can be involved and learn, train, imagine, co-create and hack. The goal is to develop artistic and scientific contributions to the greater machine learning community and of course to have fun, experiment, network and play!](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a261307-9054-46dd-810b-c85896780dab)](https://feministai.party)
